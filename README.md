📘 Project Overview

This project tests how fast a Transformer layer (a small part of models like GPT) runs on different hardware types such as CPU, GPU, and TPU. It measures how long it takes to process data and how performance changes with bigger input sizes.

Since this was run on a laptop (Intel Core i3 CPU), the current results show CPU-only performance. GPU/TPU results are discussed in the presentation slides.

⚙️ What is Benchmarking?

Benchmarking means comparing performance. Here, we compare how fast one Transformer layer runs on various hardware by measuring:

Average time (seconds)

Batch size (how many samples processed at once)

Sequence length (length of input data)

🧩 Hardware Tested

CPU: Intel Core i3 10th Gen (Laptop)

GPU / TPU: Results referenced from presentation (H100, A100, TPU v4, MI300X)

🧠 Key Idea: CPU vs GPU vs TPU Type Description Example CPU General-purpose processor with few cores. Great for basic tasks. Intel Core i3, i7 GPU Thousands of smaller cores specialized for parallel math. Best for AI models. NVIDIA A100, H100 TPU Custom chip built by Google just for AI matrix operations. Google TPU v4 🧪 How to Run 1️⃣ Create Environment python -m venv venv venv\Scripts\activate pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Run Benchmark python src/benchmark.py

3️⃣ Plot Results python src/plot_results.py

Output Files

results/results.csv → Timing results

results/benchmark_plot.png → Graph of latency vs batch size

📊 Example Result (CPU) Batch Size Seq Length Avg Time (s) 1 512 0.0793 8 1024 0.9467 32 2048 8.3274

Larger sequences or batches take more time because the CPU processes them sequentially.

🧾 Future Improvements

Add GPU and TPU benchmarks (using Google Colab or cloud).

Compare energy usage and cost per performance.

Automate plots for hardware comparison.
